I am a research engineer at [Meta AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/), working with Ilya Mironov and Mike Rabbat. I graduated with a Masters from UC Davis in 2019, where I worked with Prem Devanbu and Vincent Hellendoorn. My research interests include federated learning and differential privacy.
